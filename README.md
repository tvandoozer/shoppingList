# Overview

- This shopping list app has all of the basic functionality such as creating, reading, updating and deleting items from the shopping list.

## Future

- When we start getting into concepts like navigation and storing data in the database, I would like to add a bottom tab navigator for navigation through Home, sign-in, sign-up, and add item screens.
- In the future I also want users to be able to add more details than just the title in each item such as "details", "price", and "quantity".
- A "total price" section in the app would also be interesting but not a priority.
